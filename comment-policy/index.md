/*Approved by Jnanadarshan Nayak*/

Unlike the Wild West of most of the Internet, I have a very strict comment policy on my blog <a href="https://jnan.co">**jnan.co**</a> or on my personal website <a href="https://www.jdnayak.com">**www.jdnayak.com**</a> . If you’re an a`**`hole, you’ll be banned. Sorry, a`**`holes!

That, most important, statement out of the way, here’s more you should know whether you’re a regular commenter or new to the site.

If your comment does not immediately appear on the site after posting, it may have been flagged for review. There are a number of things which will get your comment flagged for review, I ask that you please keep that in mind before resubmitting the comment multiple times or contacting me about it.

* Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs disqus has on their blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it won’t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.
* Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.
* Fluctuations in the space time continuum. Sometimes things just get auto-flagged and I don’t know why.
* Comments can also be flagged for review by my readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes my moderation jobs a lot harder).

### Here are some things which will get your comment deleted.

* Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post/website. This can run from name calling to sentences which include the words “people like you” or statements which begin “I bet you” or “you must/probably” etc. This is regardless of what “side” you’re on.
* Jokes or aggressive negative comments on the aesthetic appearance of a person (commenters, writers, and folks mentioned in an article alike).
* Hate speech or other clearly intentional jerk behavior. This includes, but is not limited to: the use of the word feminazi or a comments which denigrates women, feminism or feminists, the LGBTQ community; broad imprecations or assumptions based on race; and anything that amounts to “ugh the gays,” “ugh liberals,” “ugh, fangirls,” etc.

There will be some who look at these rules and think that the I have too much power to shut down conversations. I have one responses to this.

First & Last: **It’s my site, I get to make the rules**. I'm not taking away your freedom of speech by deleting/banning you. You can take your anger elsewhere, I don’t want it.

*The comment system is powered by Disqus. All the data is saved by disqus and I have limited access to the user data only through Disqus admin panel. Please visit <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for more details.*
