***The Lightning port***
 So what does it take to remove an age old proprietary 3.5 mm headphone jack and force millions of people to use the [lightning port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_%28connector%29)? Apple introduced the lightning port back in 2012 capable of carrying power, data and audio over a single port. Then why wait till 2016 to remove the headphone jack? Chief of marketing at Apple Phil Schiller says it took [courage](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage) to do that. Was Apple not courageous enough all these years to do the right thing as they claim? Probably the answer is AirPods. Like it or not AirPods is the most advanced piece of headphone that is produced till date. As Jony Ive says AirPods is the first product in a wireless future Apple is working on for some time. The real challenge for Apple was not to replace one port with another but to develop a product that is wireless, easy to use, connects with Apple ecosystem and has Siri built in. So AirPods might be the first hint towards a completely wireless iPhone of the future.

The Lightning port on iPhone or Micro USB/ USB-C ports on Androids has three primary functions. Charging, Data Transfer and connecting peripherals like headphones and OTGs. The company first to offer these three functions wirelessly will produce world’s first true wireless device. Now let’s look one by one and see where Apple stands.
Charging
This is the single most important function on any mobile device for a port. Apple needs to find a solution if it has to make the iPhone completely wireless. Wireless charging has been on Samsung Galaxy flagships for years, but Apple never embraced Wireless charging. Part of the problem was a technical limitation. Apple uses metal unibody for its devices and you might be aware that until late 2015 there was no solution for wireless charging on a metal device. Qualcomm solved that problem in 2015 and announced wireless charging for mobiles with metal devices was now possible.
