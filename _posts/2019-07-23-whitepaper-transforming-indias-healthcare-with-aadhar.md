### Summary

 We Indians are very negligent of our health and we visit doctor only in case something goes wrong. We do not save our medical records. There is almost zero possibility that we can actually present a family medical history even verbally when diagnosed or suspected with a hereditary condition like asthma. If AADHAR enables the Govt. to see who are the family members we can solve the issue in a very short period. 

 Please read the whitepaper to know how we can transform the healthcare with AADHAR.
